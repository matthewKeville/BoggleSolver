JTable is not suiting my needs, It seems unnecessarily complex to have it display data that is not associated 
by fixed dimensions. I will look into making a custom table ( from JPanel and JLabel ) to avoid the 
complexity of JTable.

If row data was consistent, or column data it would make sense , but not for boggle
